    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a variation on one of my monthly rotations really featuring a homemade red sauce more than anything else. Also, for those that actually read this, I've written it more as shorthand since the purpose of the project is to practice html vs pure copywriting.</p>
    <p><em>Note: this exact variation uses bacon fat but that can be subbed for olive oil for a true vegetarian dish</em></p>
    <p>Serves 12</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp bacon fat/olive oil</li>
